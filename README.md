## 🛠️ Tasks Completed
### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values using median imputation.  
- Checked and corrected inconsistencies (e.g., Profit = Revenue - Expenses).  
- Detected outliers using boxplots and Z-scores.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Computed descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.  
- Visualized:
  - 📈 Revenue & Expenses trends (line chart)  
  - 📦 Profit & Cash Flow distributions (boxplots)  
  - 📊 Expenses by category (bar/pie chart, if available)  

### 3. Correlation Analysis
- Built a correlation matrix for Revenue, Expenses, Profit, and Debt.  
- Key insights:
  - Revenue & Profit → strongly positively correlated.  
  - Debt & Profit → moderately negatively correlated.
